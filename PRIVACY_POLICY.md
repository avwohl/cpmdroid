**Last Updated:** January 12, 2026

## Overview

CPMDroid is a CP/M emulator for Android. This privacy policy explains how the app handles user data.

## Data Collection

**CPMDroid does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.** The app runs entirely on your device and does not:

- Collect personal identifiers
- Track your location
- Access your contacts, photos, or other personal files
- Use analytics or tracking services

## Network Access

CPMDroid accesses the internet solely to download optional disk images from GitHub. Specifically:

- **What is downloaded:** CP/M disk images and a disk catalog file from the GitHub releases area (https://github.com/avwohl/ioscpm/releases/)
- **When:** Only when you choose to download a disk image through the app's disk management interface, or on first launch to download a default boot disk
- **Data sent:** Standard HTTP requests containing only the file being requested

### Third-Party Services

- Your IP address
