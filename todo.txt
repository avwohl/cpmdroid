Todo list:
- add a confirm dialog to restart the emulator
a user complained of hitting restart instead of pause
and loosing work

- the new code we added to check for writes to disks in the manifest
that may be overwritten by a new release got relased and does work.
however, i deleted the previous version and installed and it came up
with the checkbox in settings off. by default it should come up on.
fix the problem. change the settings version so everyone will get the
default settings

- we tested the smartkeyboard pro changes and they worked.  I did  clean
install from the store it does not. there is big black band above the keyboard 
now and we are missing afew lines of text.
see c:\temp\Screeenshot*

- when the app is run in it somehow is flagged as using sound. i think the romwbw has some sound midi output?
is there a way to flag it as indcidental? if I am listing to and audio book and run our emulator the book
stops.  I can see the program might make a bell sound.  But by default books should continue. It may
make sense to have an enable sound checkbox.

- In a sound releated issue, see docs/midi.md. A user says the RC2014 driver has some clock on it
so we don't need to slow our emulator. Research the RC2014 driver and see how much work it would be.
See if it can also do a clock.  See how much could could be in hbios_dispatch and shared and how much would be Android only.  Update this midi.md with findings
