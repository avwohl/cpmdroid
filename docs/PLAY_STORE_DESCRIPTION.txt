CPMDroid - CP/M Emulator for Android

Step back in time and experience the golden age of personal computing on your Android device. CPMDroid is a full-featured Z80/CP/M emulator that brings the classic 8-bit operating system to your phone or tablet.

What is CP/M?

CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers) was the dominant operating system for personal computers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, before MS-DOS and Windows. It ran on millions of machines and hosted legendary software including WordStar, dBASE, Turbo Pascal, and countless games and utilities. Now you can run this historic software anywhere.

Authentic Emulation

CPMDroid is built on the RomWBW HBIOS platform, providing accurate Z80 CPU emulation with proper instruction timing. This isn't a simplified simulator—it's a complete hardware-level emulator that runs real CP/M software exactly as it ran on original hardware.
